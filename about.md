[fiber-note](https://github.com/namiwang/fiber-note) is a bi-directional networked note-taking app which is open and self-hosting, inspired by `roam-research`, `obsidian` and others.

## references.wiki

</a>

I watched so many tv shows (especially sitcoms) that I have to build [references.wiki](https://references.wiki) to organize and visualize pop culture references between tv shows, video games, ficional characters, etc.

I built my own knowledge base to cross-reference sources like wikidata, google kg,  and wolfram alpha. I implemented a customized editor for user to create new references between works, still not satisfied with current workflow though.

## ruby on rust

[https://github.com/ruby-on-rust/ruby-on-rust](https://github.com/ruby-on-rust/ruby-on-rust)

An implementation of ruby in pure rust, consists of (barely working) lexer and parser, and a no-go interpreter.

I started this project as a way to learn rust. Eventually, I've learnt more than that, including lexer & parser, `ragel`, and a lot of ruby's hidden magic.

Lots of the grammar rules and AST conventions are ripped from the `parser` gem. For lexer, I adapated some rules from `parser` and ported from ragel-6 to ragel-7 For parser, I use `syntax-cli` as parser generator.

## project yoru

[Project yoru](https://github.com/project-yoru) is a set of projects to build cross-platform visual novel games from assets and scripts.

To build this project, I was using `polymer`, lots of `gulp` scripts, `phonegap` (and phonegap build), which is all (basically) died by now \:\|
